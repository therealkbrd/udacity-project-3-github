### Project Overview
A Python project to explore bike share systems.

### General Description
This Python project explores data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

### Project Details
Program asks user to to specify a city (chicago, new york or washington), month (february or all), and day of the week (sunday or all) to analyze. After choosing the correct city, month, and day the program will print the following information:

* most popular month
* most popular day of week
* most popular hour of day
* most popular hour
* most commonly used start station
* most commonly used end station
* most commonly used combination of start station and end station trip
* total travel time
* average travel time
* counts of each user type
* counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
* earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

And in the end user can choose: restart program or not.  

### Files
Project.py - includes the whole main code, which shows all work with Python using pandas.

### The Datasets
Files with data contain the next six columns:

* Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
* End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
* Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
* Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
* End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
* User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

* Gender
* Birth Year

### Used Software
1. You should have Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
2. Text editor, like Atom or any other
3. A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows)
